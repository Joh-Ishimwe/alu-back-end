API

Bash is typically the only programming language that traditional system administrators know, therefore they write their scripts in it. Although Bash works great for a lot of tasks, it may become unorganized and inefficient quite quickly when compared to other programming languages. The new breed of system administrators, sometimes known as SREs, are essentially software engineers in the traditional sense; however, instead of creating products, their job is to manage systems. Furthermore, they are far more knowledgeable than their forebears in areas other than Bash scripting.

Using an API is a common method of exposing a dataset and application. They frequently serve as the publicly accessible portion of microservices and websites, enabling other users to interact with them and access and alter their data. With this undertaking you will access employee data via an API to organize and export them to different data structures.
